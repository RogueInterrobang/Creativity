philosophical notes

1 what are the principles we use to form relations between things (association, contiguity, other Humean 
things), and how do we ensre we overcome these as they are a key boundary?

2 working knowledge is not the things we know but how (easily/quickly/expansively) we are able to manipulate the 
possible relations between those things 

3 relations should not be understood as binary for creative purposes but any combination (like foam, matrices) - 
four dimensional including time, and therefore able to include motivation and intention as items in a relation 
chain
